# lfp-elm-talk

*August 21st 2019*


The files for my elm talk at the london functional programmers meetup.

## Requirements
+ npm or yarn
+ Latex with the beamer package

## Installation

Elm can be most easily installed with `yarn` or `npm`. With these programs installed you can run

> `npm install -g elm`

or

>`yarn global add elm`

to install the elm binaries.


## Slides

To make the slides you need to have latex installed with the beamer extension.
Texlive is the recommended distribution.
